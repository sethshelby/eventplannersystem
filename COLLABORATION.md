## üîÑ Real-Time Collaboration Workflow

### Best Practices

1. **Always Pull Before You Start Working**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Commit Often with Clear Messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fixed login bug"
   git commit -m "Added new store feature"
   git commit -m "Updated schedule display"
   ```

3. **Push Regularly**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Communicate with Your Team**
   - Tell others what you're working on
   - Avoid working on the same file at the same time
   - Use descriptive commit messages

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you and a friend edit the same file, you might get a merge conflict:

```bash
# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# If there's a conflict, Git will tell you which files
# Open the conflicted files and look for:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> main

# Edit the file to keep what you want
# Remove the conflict markers (<<<, ===, >>>)

# Stage the resolved files
git add .

# Commit the merge
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## üì± Staying in Sync

### Quick Sync Command
Create an alias to make syncing easier:

```bash
# Pull latest changes, then push your changes
git pull origin main && git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push origin main
```

### Check Status Anytime
```bash
# See what's changed locally
git status

# See commit history
git log --oneline -10

# See what others have done
git pull origin main --dry-run
```

---

## üö® Emergency Commands

### Undo Last Commit (Before Push)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Discard All Local Changes
```bash
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### See What Changed in Last Commit
```bash
git show
```
